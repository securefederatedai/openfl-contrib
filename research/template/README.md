## Abstract

[Provide a concise summary of the research, highlighting the main objectives, methods, and findings. This section should give readers a quick understanding of the project's significance and contributions.]

## Overview

The aim of this template is to provide a starting point for setting up your federated learning experiment and integrating your research into OpenFL. This repository serves as a space to host and showcase the innovative work you have been doing within the open-source community. Feel free to customize the workflow as needed, and consider implementing your own functionality or raising issues/requests for any features you find lacking. Our goal is to foster an outstanding framework for the research community and create an efficient pipeline to integrate research into the core OpenFL framework.

## Running the Experiment

Generally, OpenFL's workflow interface can be run entirely as a Jupyter Notebook, but you may wish to call out any special instructions, especially if you introduced any unique customizations.

## Results

[Summarize the key findings of the research. You may want to include any relevant charts, graphs, or tables that illustrate the results. You may also provide links to additional resources or publications related to the project.]
