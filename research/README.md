# OpenFL-contrib Research

Welcome to the OpenFL repository of research contributions. This repo contains a template for setting up a federated learning experiment using OpenFL's experimental workflow interface. The template is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to adapt it to your specific use case.

## Overview

The goal of this template is not to provide strict guidelines, but rather a starting point for setting up your experiment and integrating your research into OpenFL. You should think of this as your space to host and showcase the amazing work that you have been doing to the open source community. Feel free to customize the workflow as you see fit. Also you should feel empowered to implement your own functionality or raise an issue/request for any functionality that you think is lacking. Ultimately, we want to create an outstanding framework for the research community and an efficient pipeline to welcome research into the core OpenFL framework.
